# Welcome to my completed Week 2 Studio!
I chose to switch the centering of all maps to Narragansett Town Beach in Rhode Island and make some minor style tweaks to match the first leaflet map. I also created a second CSS sheet so that the fourth page could be styled to match my custom mapbox style as well as the design of the Rhode Island Historical Society. All instructional pages used are maintained in this repository. Shout-out to Mapbox and W3Schools for their invaluable reference materials, and of course my instructor Shadrock Roberts and Clark University.

##Output 1
The first output is an embedded styled leaflet tile. I chose the Pioneer style from Thunderforest, which required creating an account with them to get an API key. I then made some basic color tweaks to the CSS sheet to match this style, borrowing some colors using [Instant Eyedropper](https://instant-eyedropper.com).

##Output 2
The second output is an embedded mapbox tile. I kept this one the same as in the tutorial, only changing the center location.

##Output 3
The third output is a mapbox tile with a custom marker and popup defined in the HTML. The marker indicates a wrecked barge that sits just off the beach that not many people know about. I've snuck out there in the off-season for SCUBA and free diving many times and if you get the conditions just right it's absolutely gorgeous. It's popular with local spearfishers as its always swarming with Tautog. It's big enough that you can see it in [satellite imagery!](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.4358932,-71.4513854,589m/data=!3m1!1e3)

##Output 4
The final output is an embedded mapbox tile with a customized mapbox style. This style was created to match the color scheme of the Rhode Island Historical Society, an organization that's dear to my heart. Among many other responsibilities they operate my favorite museum: [the Woonsocket Museum of Work & Culture](https://www.rihs.org/locations/museum-of-work-culture/). After creating the style, I created a second CSS sheet so that this page could be styled separately to match the RIHS website.
