### Creating a Custom Mapbox Style
- [Follow the Mapbox tutorial for creating a custom style](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-custom-style/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem%7Cgoogle%7Cbrand%7Cchko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-bjyBRCcARIsAFboWg0c06wf34jAP1XV8i53wUBsfaO3P-sB5wC7sPMMxcgBtUjstEN5330aAuPhEALw_wcB), which will walk you through creating a map using Mapbox corporate colors. 
- Once you've done this, your next step will be to create another style to match the corporate colors of your favorite international development, environmental, humanitarian, or non-profit organizations. For example, if I wanted to make a map for the U.S. Agency for International Development, I'd do some online research to see if I could find any "branding" or "design guidelines" ([like this](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1869/USAID_GSM-02_04_2020.pdf)), which might give me specific information on the colors they use. If I *couldn't* find any branding guidelines for my favorite organiztion, I might try [entering the organization's URL into a website that would crawl the code to pick out specific colors](https://www.colorcombos.com/grabcolors.html) or use a [web browser extension to select colors on screen and find out what they are](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=en). You could also use the [developer tools built into Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) or [in Mozilla Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) (my favorite browser!) that we looked at in class to inspect elements of a web page including the HTML and .css files. In any case, make your webmap sing with the colors of your favorite organization!

### Adding Custom Mapbox Style to Page
